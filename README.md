A complex countdown clock, NTP client, and embedded HTTP server on an Arduino.

Originally created for Regis Jesuit High School's freshman retreat program as a countdown to build excitement before the event started. It started out with a simple countdown and ballooned into a project that included a built-in webserver with a tiny HTTP API and an NTP client connecting over an unblocked port on the school's network.
